# Tropical Cyclones
## Overview
This repository holds an application of computer vision to the detection and categorization of Tropical Cyclones using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data. This project is the result of a joint research collaboration between the Φ-lab (ESRIN/ESA) and Ifremer. 

The code developed was used for the following publication to [IGARSS 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9554111):
> A. R. Carmo, N. Longépé, A. Mouche, D. Amorosi and N. Cremer, **Deep Learning Approach for Tropical Cyclones Classification based on C-Band Sentinel-1 SAR Images**, 2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS, 2021, pp. 3010-3013, doi:10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554111.

This repository is intended as a means to reproduce the results shown in the paper and to stimulate further research in this direction.
